    "answer": "The search bar on WayBack APK allows you to perform targeted searches to find specific APK versions.

This field is useful for general searches if you are not sure about the exact package name.\n- Package Name: Enter the unique package name (e.g., com.example.app) associated with the Android app. This provides a more accurate search result and is recommended if you know the package name.\n- Developer Name: This field allows you to filter APKs by the developer's name. This is particularly useful if you are looking for applications developed by a specific developer or organization.\n- Categories: You can select multiple categories to narrow down the search results to specific types of apps, such as games, productivity, etc.\n- Downloadable: This toggle switch allows you to filter search results to only show APKs that are available for download.

    "question": "What should I do if I cannot find a specific APK version?",
    "answer": "If you cannot find a specific APK version, it could be due to several reasons:\n\n- The APK version may not have been archived or collected yet.\n- Your search criteria may be too narrow. Try broadening the search by removing some filters.\n- Ensure you have the correct spelling for the APK name or package name.\n\nIf you still cannot find the APK version you're looking for, you can contact our support team for further assistance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I understand the permissions requested by an APK?",
    "answer": "Each APK version listed in the search results includes a section on permissions. Permissions indicate what access the app requires on your device (e.g., camera, contacts, storage). It's important to review these permissions carefully to understand the potential security and privacy implications. If an APK requests permissions that seem unnecessary for its functionality, it may be a red flag, and you should consider whether or not to install it."
